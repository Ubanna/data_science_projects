Exercises on python classes

Create a ​Pets​ class that holds instances of dogs; this class is completely separate from the Dog​ class. In other words, the ​Dog​ class does not inherit from the ​Pets​ class. Then assign three dog instances to an instance of the ​Pets​ class. Start with the following code below.
Save the file as ​pets_class.py.​

Your output should look like this:

Starter code:
I have 3 dogs.
Tom is 6.
Fletcher is 7.
Larry is 9.
And they're all mammals, of course
